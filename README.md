# Tennis Court Classification with TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project aims to apply the power of Convolutional Neural Networks within TensorFlow to classify images of tennis courts into one of three categories: clay, grass, or hard court. Utilizing a dataset of diverse tennis court images, the model undergoes rigorous training and optimization phases, including techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and data augmentation to enhance its performance and efficiency.

The final model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images of tennis courts and receive instant classification results. This not only demonstrates the model's practical application but also serves as an accessible way for users to engage with and test the model's capabilities.
